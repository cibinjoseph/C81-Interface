# C81-Interface
A collection of subroutines and functions in Fortran that help with parsing and creating C81 formatted airfoil tables.

## Documentation
Usage and documentation for the module can be found [here](https://cibinjoseph.github.io/C81-Interface/page/index.html). This documentation was created using the automatic documentation generator for Fortran programs, [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford).

## Notes
While this library was heavily used during my PhD, towards the end, I fell in love with Python and developed a similar library that is a tad more flexible. Users interested in this library might also find the following libraries useful: 
1. [c81utils](https://github.com/cibinjoseph/c81utils)
2. [csv-c81](https://github.com/cibinjoseph/csv-c81)
